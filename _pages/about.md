# About This UPSC Digital Garden 🌱

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is more than just a collection of notes—it's a **living, growing ecosystem of interconnected knowledge**. Unlike traditional note-taking where information sits in isolated silos, this garden allows ideas to cross-pollinate and build upon each other, just like knowledge works in the real world.

## Why This Approach for UPSC?

<div class="category-section">
  <div class="category-title">🎯 The UPSC Connection Advantage</div>
  <p>UPSC preparation requires understanding how different topics interconnect. Constitutional provisions link to historical events, geographical features influence political boundaries, and current affairs touch every subject. This digital garden reflects these natural connections.</p>

### Key Features

- **🔗 Bidirectional Linking**: When you link to a note, it automatically shows up in the "Linked Notes" section of that note
- **📊 Visual Knowledge Graph**: See how all your notes connect in an interactive network
- **🏷️ Smart Organization**: Notes are organized by subject but connected across boundaries
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Study on any device, anywhere
- **🔍 Quick Navigation**: Find related concepts instantly through the link network

## How to Use This Garden

### Creating Connections
Use double brackets `[[Note Name]]` to link related concepts. For example:
- Link [[Constitutional Amendment]] to [[Judiciary]] when discussing judicial review
- Connect [[Emergency Provisions]] to historical examples
- Relate [[Geography]] concepts to [[Polity]] when discussing federalism

### Navigation Tips
- Start from the main categories on the homepage
- Follow links between related topics
- Use the visual graph to discover unexpected connections
- Check the "Linked Notes" sidebar to see what connects to your current topic

### Best Practices
1. **Link Early and Often**: Don't just link obvious connections—link related concepts too
2. **Use Descriptive Titles**: Make note titles clear and searchable
3. **Update Regularly**: Add new connections as you learn more
4. **Review Connected Notes**: When studying a topic, always check its linked notes

## The Philosophy

> "Knowledge is not a collection of facts, but a network of connections."

This digital garden embodies the idea that learning happens best when we can see how ideas relate to each other. Instead of memorizing isolated facts, you're building a web of understanding that mirrors how knowledge actually works.

## Technical Details

This garden is built using:
- **Jekyll** for static site generation
- **Custom bidirectional linking** system
- **Interactive note graphs** for visualization
- **Modern, responsive design** for all devices
