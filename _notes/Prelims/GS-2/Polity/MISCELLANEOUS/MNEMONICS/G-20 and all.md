The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the primary body responsible for conducting various examinations for government positions in India, presents a challenging syllabus for the Civil Services Examination. The extensive syllabus can be daunting, raising questions about the feasibility of covering it in its entirety, the practicality of doing so for the examination, and the amount of information that can be effectively retained.

To successfully pass the Civil Services Exam and secure prestigious positions such as IAS, IPS, IFS, and others, aspirants need a well-planned strategy, proper guidance, and unwavering dedication and determination.

To simplify the preparation process, aspirants can incorporate shortcuts while making notes to facilitate easy revision and enhance memory retention. One such effective shortcut technique is the use of mnemonics.

What is a mnemonic?
-------------------

A mnemonic is a technique where a pattern of letters or ideas is designed to aid in remembering something. There is no set rule or defined way to design or form a mnemonic. You can create your own, customizing it to suit your ease of recall.

We present some mnemonics that can be beneficial in your UPSC Exam Preparation, making revision and memorization easier.

1.  Technique to recall _**G-20 Countries** (Total Number of Countries – 20)_

* * *

Remembering all 20 countries in the Group 20 can be challenging. Here's a mnemonic technique based on vowels and consonants to help you memorize them.

**Vowels:** A, E, I, O, U

**Consonants:** The rest of the alphabet

The names of some of the countries in the group start with the vowels A, E, I, and U. The vowel 'O' is missing, so we substitute it with the names of countries that begin with consonants as follows:

A, E, I, BFGMCJRST, U. But how do we remember these countries that begin with consonants, which have replaced the vowel 'O'? Here's a trick.

BFGMCJRST: **watching****BFGM & CJ7 on RSTv (**_read it as_**watching Big Fat Greek Marriage and CJ7 on RSTv –Rajya Saba Tv (BFGM & CJ7 movies)**

You might be familiar with the movies 'Big Fat Greek Wedding' and 'CJ7'. Alter 'wedding' to 'marriage' for the mnemonic.
