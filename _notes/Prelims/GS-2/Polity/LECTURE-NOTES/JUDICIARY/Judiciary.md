# 🇮🇳 INDIAN JUDICIARY SYSTEM 🏛️ 

India's judiciary is defined as an **INDEPENDENT, INTEGRATED, and PYRAMIDAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM**.

## 🏗️ The Pyramidal Structure
Illustrates the hierarchy:
*   🟢 **Top Tier – Supreme Court (SC)**
    *   Single highest judicial authority.
    *   Handles constitutional interpretation and appeals.
    *   Represents the apex of the pyramid.
*   🟣 **Middle Tier – High Courts (HC)**
    *   Described as "few."
    *   Serve individual states or groups of states.
    *   Deal with appeals from lower courts and writ petitions.
*   🔵 **Bottom Tier – Subordinate Courts**
    *   Labelled "many" (District Courts, Magistrate Courts).
    *   Manage the bulk of everyday legal cases at the grassroots level.
    *   Broad accessibility due to widespread presence.

**Key Roles:**
*   Higher Courts: **Interpretive role**.
*   Lower Courts: **Broad accessibility**.

## ⚖️ Integrated vs. Dual Judiciary

*   🇺🇸 **United States:** Follows a **dual system**.
    *   Separate federal and state courts.
    *   Federal courts apply Union (federal) laws.
    *   State courts apply state-specific laws.
    *   Result: A crime in one state might be legal in another; punishments vary.
*   🇮🇳 **India:** Follows an **integrated judiciary system**.
    *   Single unified judicial structure.
    *   Same law and punishment apply nationwide for a given crime (whether in Mumbai or Delhi).
    *   Union and State laws are interpreted and enforced by this single system.
    *   Ensures **uniformity and coherence** in law application.

➡️ **LAW SHOULD BE UNIFORM**
This is a core principle. As a famous quote says: *"The only thing worse than No law is Non Uniform law; the law must be written and clear."*

---

## 🔗 Doctrine of Precedent (Stare Decisis)

*   Meaning: *"Stand by what has been decided."*
*   Ensures decisions by higher courts are **binding on lower courts**.
*   Promotes **consistency, stability, and predictability**.
*   📜 **Article 141 (Constitution of India):** "Law declared by Supreme Court to be binding on all courts The law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India." This is the **LAW OF THE LAND**.
*   Supreme Court decisions: Binding on ALL courts in India.
*   High Court rulings: Apply within their respective jurisdictions.
*   Upholds judicial discipline and coherent law application.

➡️ **Appeal Process + Stare Decisis = Integrated Structure**
This combination (pyramidal structure for appeals and the doctrine of precedent) defines India's integrated judicial structure, contrasting with the US dual judiciary.

---

## 🛡️ Independence of Judiciary (Independent Integrated Judicial System)

Rooted in Montesquieu’s **theory of separation of powers**:
*   **Legislature:** Makes laws 📝
*   **Executive:** Implements laws ⚙️
*   **Judiciary:** Interprets and enforces laws ⚖️

**Judiciary's Role:**
*   **Impartial and neutral third party** in resolving legal disputes.
*   Ensures justice is delivered fairly and without bias.
*   Based on **Principles of Natural Justice (P.O.N.J.)**: fairness, equality, right to be heard.
*   💼 **Example:** *Vashu vs Union of India* – shows individuals can bring the state to court, and the state can be held accountable. **No one is above the law.**

### ❓ Is Judiciary Part of the 'State' When Performing Judicial Functions?
**Answer: NO** 🚫
*   While an organ of the state, it's **not strictly "State"** during core judicial functions.
*   Must remain **independent and immune** from executive/legislative control during adjudication.
*   Ensures courts cannot be sued or interfered with by the state when discharging constitutional duties.
*   Landmark Case: ***Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar v. State of Maharashtra (1966)***
    *   SC Held: When a court acts in its **judicial capacity**, it's NOT 'State' under Article 12 (not subject to writ jurisdiction for judicial decisions).
    *   However, its **administrative actions** CAN be challenged under writs (as they fall within 'State' definition).

**Constitutional Safeguards for Independence:**
*   Security of tenure for judges.
*   Protection against arbitrary removal.
*   Separation from political pressures.

➡️ This **independent and integrated judicial structure** guarantees:
*   Consistency (via precedent).
*   Appealability.
*   Reinforces **constitutional supremacy, rule of law, and protection of individual rights**.
*   Motto: **#NOFEARNOFAVOUR**

### ⚠️ Committed Judiciary vs. Independent Judiciary
*   **Committed Judiciary:** Judges align with Executive + Legislature (E+L). Becomes a tool of government. Undermines rule of law, liberty, fairness, freedom.
    *   Example: PM Indira Gandhi's advocacy for a committed judiciary during the 1970s Emergency.
*   **Independent Judiciary:** Free from political pressure. Upholds constitutional principles, protects citizens' rights, ensures true justice. Essential for democracy.

---

## 🏛️ Doctrine of Separation of Powers

*   Division of legislative, executive, and judicial functions.
*   Minimizes arbitrary excesses by government (sanction of all three branches needed).
*   Prevents concentration of excessive power in any single branch.
*   **PROTECTS FROM TYRANNY & ARBITRARY POWER OF THE STATE.**
*   🇺🇸 Entire US polity is based on strict Separation of Powers:
    *   Capitol (Legislature): Makes federal laws.
    *   White House (Executive): Carries out laws.
    *   Supreme Court (Judiciary): Interprets federal constitutional law, ensures checks and balances.

# 🟢 SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 🟢

📜 **Articles 124-147** deal with the Supreme Court.
📜 **Article 124:** "There shall be a supreme court." (Mandatory)

## ⏳ Evolution and Powers

*   **Pre-Independence:** Each state had its High Court as the highest state judicial authority. Privy Council in London was the ultimate court of appeal.
*   **Government of India Act, 1935:** Proposed a Federal Court (never fully realized as India wasn't a true federation then).
*   **Post-Independence (1947):** Supreme Court established in **1950**.
    *   Inherited and combined powers of the proposed Federal Court AND the Privy Council.
    *   Became one of the world's most powerful judicial bodies.
*   Pandit Nehru's concern: SC might become a "third chamber of legislation" or super-legislature/super-executive (somewhat proven true due to its influence).

**Today, the SC is recognized as:**
*   Custodian of the Constitution 📜
*   Guardian of the Doctrine of Separation of Powers 🛡️
*   Authority on Judicial Review 🧐
*   Upholder of Rule of Law ⚖️

## Jurisdictions of the Supreme Court (Extent of Power)

🔑 **Mnemonic for SC Jurisdictions:** "O W A A R"
*   **O**riginal Jurisdiction
*   **W**rit Jurisdiction
*   **A**ppellate Jurisdiction
*   **A**dvisory Jurisdiction
*   **R**evisional Jurisdiction

### 1️⃣ Original Jurisdiction (Article 131)
*   Court of 1st instance (hearing the case for the first time).
    *   Subordinate courts: Usually 1st instance in CRIMINAL cases.
    *   Civil cases: Subordinate court or High Court (depends on pecuniary value).
*   **Exclusive Original Jurisdiction of SC in:**
    *   Disputes between Centre and State(s).
    *   Disputes between States.
    *   ➡️ **CENTER ↔️ STATE**
    *   ➡️ **STATE ↔️ STATE**
    *   ➡️ **CENTER + STATE(s) ↔️ STATE(s)**
*   For **INDIVIDUALS:** Extensive original jurisdiction only via **Article 32 (Writ Jurisdiction)** for violation of Fundamental Rights.

### 2️⃣ Writ Jurisdiction (Article 32)
*   Individuals can directly approach SC if Fundamental Rights are violated.
*   (More details under "WRITS" section).

### 3️⃣ Appellate Jurisdiction (Articles 132, 133, 134)
*   SC is the **highest appellate court**.
*   **EVERY AND ANY CASE CAN REACH THE SC IN THE FORM OF AN APPEAL.**
*   Appeals from High Court judgments, decrees, or final orders (civil & criminal).

#### 🚧 Screening Mechanisms for Appeals to SC:
*   Challenge: Only 34 judges (CJI + 33) vs. many HCs & subordinate courts, crores of potential cases.
*   From Subordinate Courts to High Courts: Jump is relatively easier.
*   From High Court to Supreme Court: Not easy. Two main ways:

    *   **(A) Article 136 – Special Leave Petition (SLP)**
        *   SC may, **in its discretion**, grant special leave to appeal from ANY judgment, decree, order, etc., of ANY court/tribunal in India (except Armed Forces tribunals).
        *   SLP is a **permission** to appeal, not a right.
        *   Focus: **Substantial Question of Law (S.Q.L)** or **Interpretation of Constitution of India (COI)**.
        *   SC does NOT re-examine factual evidence unless gross miscarriage of justice or violation of legal/constitutional principles.
        *   Approval rate for SLPs is very low (1-2%), preventing case overload.

    *   **(B) Article 134-A – Certificate of Appeal by High Court**
        *   If the High Court itself certifies that the case involves:
            *   (a) A substantial question of law of general importance, AND
            *   (b) That question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court.
        *   With this certificate, one can directly approach SC without needing SLP.

### 4️⃣ Revisional Jurisdiction (Article 137) – Review Powers
*   SC can **review its own judgments or orders**.
*   This is an exception to the finality of SC decisions.
*   Grounds for Review Petition (must be filed within 30 days, usually heard by the same bench, often without oral arguments except e.g. death penalty cases):
    *   Discovery of new and significant issues or evidence.
    *   Mistake or error evident on the face of the record (patent errors, not minor ones).
    *   Any other substantial and sufficient reason.
*   Purpose: Correct grave errors leading to miscarriage of justice, not reassess the entire case.
*   An exception to *stare decisis* regarding its own past rulings.
*   Any aggrieved person (not just parties) can file.
*   Success rate decreases as one moves up the hierarchy; review has a very low success rate.

#### ✨ Curative Petition (A Judicial Innovation)
*   **Not mentioned in the Constitution.**
*   Evolved in ***Rupa Ashok Hurra vs Ashok Hurra (2002)***.
*   The "last chance" if anything is possible, even after review dismissal.
*   Principle: *Actus curiae neminem gravabit* (an act of the court shall prejudice no one).
*   **Conditions for Curative Petitions:**
    *   Must establish violation of principles of natural justice OR fear of bias affecting the petitioner.
    *   Must state that grounds were raised in the review petition and dismissed by circulation.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Circulated to a Bench: 3 senior-most judges + judges who passed the concerned judgment.
    *   If majority deems necessary, it proceeds to a hearing before the same Bench.
    *   May request a senior counsel as *amicus curiae* (Friend of the court).
    *   Typically decided in chambers unless open-court hearing is allowed.
*   Extremely high dismissal rate; heard by top judges including CJI + judges who dismissed the review.

### 5️⃣ Advisory Jurisdiction (Article 143) – President's Power
*   President has the privilege to ask SC's opinion on matters of law or fact of public importance that have arisen or are likely to arise.
*   Also for disputes mentioned in the proviso to Article 131.
*   SC **may** report its opinion (not bound to give advice, especially if political or for vested interests).
    *   If declining, SC must indicate reasons (*M. Ismail Faruqui v. Union of India, 1995*).
*   President is **not bound** to accept such advice.
*   This is **not administration of justice** or adjudication (no judgment/decree). It's a consultative process.
*   SC remains free to re-examine/overrule views from an Art. 143(1) opinion later in a real case.
*   Cannot be used to reconsider earlier SC decisions (that's for Art. 137 Review) - *Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, 1992*.

## 🧑‍⚖️ Appointment of Supreme Court Judges

*   **First CJI:** Sir H. J. Kania (1950–1951).
*   **Current (52nd) CJI:** Justice B. R. Gavai (since May 14, 2025).
    *   (Assumed office on May 14, 2025, succeeding Justice Sanjiv Khanna. His term is expected to end on November 23, 2025.)

**Core Principle:** Independence of Judiciary (functionally independent, not fully autonomous from the State).

📜 **Article 124: Establishment and Constitution of Supreme Court**
*   "There **shall** be a Supreme Court" (mandatory office).
*   Composition (CJI + other judges) can be increased by Parliament by law.
*   Judges appointed by the **President**, in "consultation" with CJI and other judges.

#### 🔄 The "Consultation" Conundrum & Evolution of Collegium:

*   **Pre-1973:** Consultation worked based on mutual understanding. President not formally bound if disagreement.
*   **24 April 1973: Kesavananda Bharati Case**
    *   Issue: Parliament's power to amend Constitution (Art. 368).
    *   Verdict (7:6): Parliament can amend, but NOT alter ‘Basic Structure Doctrine (B.S.D.)’.
    *   Led to friction between Indira Gandhi's Govt. & Judiciary.
*   **Supersession Incident (Post-Kesavananda Bharati):**
    *   Convention: Senior-most judge appointed as next CJI (CJI is *Primus inter pares* - first among equals).
    *   Justice A.N. Ray appointed CJI, superseding 3 senior judges (Shelat, Hegde, Grover) who were part of the majority in K.B. case.
    *   Widely criticized as an attack on judicial independence.

*   **1️⃣ First Judges Case (S.P. Gupta vs UOI, 1981)**
    *   Question: Is President's "consultation" with CJI binding?
    *   SC Answer: **NO**. Consultation does NOT mean concurrence.
    *   Result: Executive primacy in appointments. Led to issues like poor judgments, pendency.

*   **2️⃣ Second Judges Case (SCAORA vs UOI, 1993)**
    *   Question (revisited): Is consultation binding?
    *   SC Answer: **YES**. Consultation MEANS concurrence.
    *   Reasoning: Appreciated the intent of founding fathers. CJI's power is "unique, singular, and primal."
    *   **Birth of the Collegium System:** CJI to decide in consultation with a group of senior judges.
        *   For SC appointments: CJI + 4 senior-most SC judges.
        *   For HC appointments (initial proposal): CJI + 2 senior-most SC judges.

*   **3️⃣ Third Judges Case (1998 - Presidential Reference under Art. 143)**
    *   President K.R. Narayanan sought clarification on Collegium composition.
    *   SC Clarified:
        *   **SC Judges Appointment Collegium:** CJI + 4 senior-most SC judges.
        *   **HC Judges Appointment Collegium:** CJI + 2 senior-most SC judges (plus other consultations like HC CJ, Governor).

#### 🏛️ NJAC (National Judicial Appointments Commission) Episode - 99th CAA 2014

*   Problem with Collegium: Allegations of nepotism, favoritism ("judges appointing judges").
*   Parliament's Solution: **NJAC Act, 2014** (via 99th Constitutional Amendment Act, adding Article 124A).
*   **NJAC Composition (6 Members):**
    *   3 Judiciary: CJI (Chairperson) + 2 senior-most SC judges.
    *   3 Non-Judiciary: Union Law Minister + 2 Eminent Persons.
        *   Eminent Persons nominated by a panel: PM, CJI, Leader of Opposition.
*   **Challenges Raised:** Diluted judicial primacy, threatened independence of judiciary.
*   **Case: SCAORA vs Union of India (2015) (Fourth Judges Case)**
    *   SC Ruling (4:1 majority): NJAC declared **UNCONSTITUTIONAL**.
    *   Reason: Violated judicial primacy in appointments, which is part of the Basic Structure.

#### 📈 Today's Scenario:
*   **Collegium system revived**, operating under a Memorandum of Procedure (MoP).
*   Acknowledged need for reform in MoP for efficiency and fairness.
*   Ongoing debate: SC protects independence vs. Executive wants more say. System relies on understanding between judiciary and executive.

## 🚫 Removal of Supreme Court / High Court Judge

*   Extremely difficult process, ensuring judicial independence.
*   Judge is **NOT at the pleasure of the President.**
*   Process: 📜 **Article 124(4)** + **Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968**. (Same for HC judges via Art. 217).
*   **Grounds:** Proven Misbehaviour or Incapacity.

**🛡️ Removal Process (Strictly Parliamentary):**
1.  **Initiation of Motion:**
    *   Signed by: 100 Lok Sabha members OR 50 Rajya Sabha members.
2.  **Admission of Motion:**
    *   Speaker (LS) / Chairman (RS) decides admissibility.
    *   If accepted ➡️ 3-member Judicial Inquiry Committee formed:
        *   CJI or senior-most SC judge.
        *   Chief Justice of any High Court.
        *   A distinguished jurist.
3.  **Investigation Stage:**
    *   Committee investigates charges, submits report.
    *   If judge found guilty, motion proceeds.
4.  **Voting in Parliament (D-D-V: Debate, Discussion, Voting):**
    *   Must pass BOTH Houses in the **same session**.
    *   Requires **Special Majority:**
        *   2/3rd of members present and voting, AND
        *   More than 50% of total membership (absolute majority).
5.  **Presidential Order:**
    *   If passed by Parliament, motion sent to President.
    *   If President approves ➡️ Judge is removed.

➡️ **"100/50 Sign → Speaker Accepts → 3-Judge Probe → D-D-V in Houses → Prez Order → REMOVAL"**
⚠️ **Entire process is under JUDICIAL REVIEW.**
💡 **Fact:** NO judge has been removed in independent India. (e.g., Justice V. Ramaswami's removal process initiated but not completed).

## 🛡️ Protections for the Office of SC Judge

*   **Salaries, etc. (Article 125):**
    *   Salaries, allowances, pensions in **2nd Schedule**. (🧠 Trick: S for Salaries, S for Second Schedule).
    *   Determined by Parliament by law.
    *   **Cannot be changed to judge's disadvantage** after appointment (can be increased).
    *   Charged directly to **Consolidated Fund of India** (non-votable expenditure).
    *   Ensures #NOFEARNOFAVOUR.

*   **Rules of Court (Article 145):**
    *   SC can make rules for its practice/procedure (lawyers, holidays, calendar etc.), with President's approval.
    *   Power to approve constitutional benches also with CJI (exclusive power).

*   **Appointment of Acting Chief Justice (Article 126):**
    *   If CJI office vacant or CJI unable to perform duties, President appoints another SC Judge as Acting CJI.

*   **Appointment of Ad Hoc Judges (Article 127):**
    *   If lack of quorum in SC, CJI (with President's consent & consultation with HC CJ concerned) can request a qualified HC Judge to act as ad hoc SC Judge.
    *   (Note: Your text mentions "National Judicial Appointments Commission" here, which is defunct. Currently, this would be CJI-led process).

*   **Attendance of Retired Judges (Article 128):**
    *   CJI (with President's consent) can request retired SC/Federal Court/qualified HC judges to sit and act as SC Judge (subject to their consent). They get allowances and have SC judge powers but aren't deemed full SC judges.

*   **Eligibility for SC Judge (Article 124(3)):**
    *   Must be a **Citizen of India**, AND:
        1.  Judge of a High Court (or more) for at least **5 years**. OR

---

## ↔️ Transfer Powers (Supreme Court)

*   SC aims to deliver **JUSTICE**. *"Justice must not only be done but also be seen to be done."*
*   **Article 139A(1): SC's Power to Transfer Cases**
    *   Can transfer a case from one High Court to another (e.g., if same legal question in multiple HCs, for uniform decision).
    *   Can withdraw a case from HC(s) and decide it itself.
    *   Helps ensure **uniformity of law**.
    *   Requires a **Transfer Petition**.

---

## 📜 Key SC Powers & Principles

*   **Article 141: Law Declared by SC Binding (Law of the Land)**
    *   Binding on all courts in India. (Concept of Precedent)

*   **Article 144: Civil and Judicial Authorities to Act in Aid of SC**
    *   All authorities must obey and comply with SC directives.

*   **Article 142: Enforcement of Decrees & Orders – "Complete Justice"**
    *   SC can pass any decree or order necessary for doing **complete justice** in any pending matter.
    *   Enforceable throughout India.
    *   Practically gives **unlimited powers** in the pursuit of complete justice, not subject to statutory limits (cannot be curtailed by Parliament/State law).
    *   Examples:
        *   Ayodhya-Ram Janmabhoomi case: Awarding land to one party and also providing alternative land to the other.
        *   Release of Perarivalan (Rajiv Gandhi assassination case).
        *   Bhopal Gas Tragedy: Ordering interim compensation.
    *   ⚠️ **Concerns:** "Unlimited powers" raise eyebrows in a rule-of-law system.
    *   Reconciliation: Principle of **'SELF-RESTRAINT'** by judges.
        *   Quote: *"The judge even when he is free is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure."*
    *   Limitation: Power of Art. 142 cannot be used to defeat principles of natural justice.

---

## 🚫 Contempt of Court (Supreme Court & High Court)

*   A.V. Dicey's Rule of Law: Art. 14 (Lex Rex - supremacy of law, equality before law, **predominance of legal spirit**).
*   "My Lord" / "Your Honour" addresses the **Chair (the institution)**, not the person.
*   Granville Austin: Law is the command of the sovereign.
*   **Predominance of Legal Spirit:** An order from the court is an order from the State and must be obeyed.
*   Contempt powers ensure court orders are not disobeyed and its dignity is maintained.

📜 **Article 129: SC to be a Court of Record**
📜 **Article 215: HC to be a Court of Record** (Similar power)
*   **Court of Record means:**
    1.  Its proceedings, acts, and judgments are recorded for **perpetual memory**.
    2.  These records have **evidentiary value** and cannot be questioned when produced before any court.
    3.  Automatically acts as a **legal precedent**.
    4.  Has the power to **punish for contempt of itself**.

#### Types of Contempt (Defined in Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, not COI):

1.  **🔵 Civil Contempt (Disobedience):**
    *   Willful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or other process of a court.
    *   Willful breach of an undertaking given to a court.
2.  **🔴 Criminal Contempt (Insult or Prejudice):**
    *   Publication (words, spoken/written, signs, visible representations, or otherwise) of any matter or doing any other act which:
        *   **Scandalizes** or tends to scandalize, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of any court.
        *   **Prejudices** or interferes or tends to interfere with the due course of any judicial proceeding.
        *   **Interferes** or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner.

#### ⚖️ Contempt Powers vs. Parliamentary Privileges:
*   🏛️ **Parliamentary Privileges (Art. 105 & 194):** Special powers for MPs/MLAs (freedom of speech in House, punish for contempt of House). **Uncodified**, so limits can be unclear.
*   ⚖️ **Court’s Contempt Powers:** Clearly **codified** in the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, with rules and limits.

#### ✅ Defences & Considerations:
*   **Fair criticism of a judicial act/judgment (after case is decided) is NOT contempt.** (Sec. 5, Contempt of Courts Act, 1971).
*   Truth and good faith can be valid defenses.
*   Cannot hide under Art. 19 (Freedom of Speech & Expression) if it amounts to contempt.
*   🇬🇧 **British Example (Mature Judiciary):** Judges respected public opinion and free speech, not invoking contempt for harsh criticism unless direct threat to justice (Lord Denning).
*   🤔 **Do we need Contempt Laws?**
    *   Yes, but to protect the judicial process, not judges' personal image.
    *   Should not stifle criticism or academic/legal debates.

#### 🔗 Initiation of Contempt Proceedings:
*   **Subordinate Courts:** Cannot initiate contempt proceedings themselves for their own contempt. Can only make a reference to the High Court, which will then punish.
*   **High Court / Supreme Court:**
    1.  **Complaint-Based:** If an individual files a contempt petition.
        *   Requires prior consent of the **Attorney General (AG)** or **Solicitor General (SG)**. (For HC, Advocate General of the State).
        *   Ensures power isn't misused for personal scores.
    2.  ***Suo Motu* (On its own motion):**
        *   If the court itself observes contemptuous behavior.
        *   Can start proceedings directly, **without AG/SG consent**.
        *   Ensures swift action to protect court dignity.

💡 **Important Distinction:**
*"Under the constitutional scheme... the Supreme Court and the High Court both are courts of record. The High Court is not a court 'subordinate' to the Supreme Court."* – ***Tirupati Balaji Developers v. State of Bihar, 2004***.

# 🟣 HIGH COURTS (HC) 🟣

State Judiciary = High Court + Subordinate Courts.
Examples of early HCs: Calcutta, Bombay, Madras.

📜 **Article 214:** "There **shall** be a High Court for each State."
📜 **Article 231:** Parliament can establish a **common High Court** for two or more states or for two or more states and a Union Territory.
*   Example: Punjab & Haryana High Court (for Punjab, Haryana, and UT Chandigarh).

## 📍 Benches of High Court:
*   🔷 **Principal Bench:** Main seat of the HC (usually in capital/primary city).
    *   Example: Kolkata for Kolkata HC.
*   🔷 **Circuit Bench:** Temporary bench sitting at intervals in remote/UT areas.
    *   Example: Port Blair (under Kolkata HC) for Andaman & Nicobar Islands.
*   🔷 **Regional Bench:** Permanent full-time bench in a different region.
    *   Examples: Aurangabad, Nagpur, Panaji (under Mumbai HC).

## 🏛️ High Court Jurisdiction Examples

| High Court            | Jurisdiction                                             | Location           | Other Benches                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|

# 🌱 PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION (PIL)

## 🏛️ Context: Separation of Powers & Checks and Balances

*   **Evolution of Separation of Powers:**
    *   Aristotle (hinted at functional divisions).
    *   John Locke (*Two Treatises of Government* - limited government for liberty).
    *   **Montesquieu** (*The Spirit of Laws* - threefold separation: Executive, Legislative, Judiciary).
        *   To prevent power concentration (arbitrariness, autocracy, "Rex = Lex" / King is Law).
        *   Foundation for modern liberal democracies (e.g., USA).

*   **Doctrine of Checks and Balances:** Power distributed and controlled.
    *   No organ supreme/tyrannical. Each checks others. Maintains constitutional democracy.
    *   🔵 **Legislative Checks:**
        *   On Executive: Question hour, debates, motions, tax approval, impeach President.
        *   On Judiciary: Constitutional amendments (to override decisions), impeachment of judges.
    *   🔴 **Judiciary Checks:**
        *   On Legislature: Judicial review (can declare laws unconstitutional).
        *   On Executive: Judicial review (can declare executive actions unconstitutional).
    *   🟣 **Executive Checks:**
        *   On Legislature: Ordinance making, summon/adjourn/dissolve legislature, veto bills.
        *   On Judiciary: Appointment of Judges.

*   **Separation of Powers in India vs. USA:**
    *   🇺🇸 **USA:** Strict, rigid separation. Organs have compartmentalized functions.
    *   🇮🇳 **India:** Flexible application. Not as strict. (*Indira Gandhi vs Raj Narain case, 1975* - SC noted flexible method, but encroachment leads to imbalance).

## 🌊 Judicial Activism vs. Judicial Restraint

*   **Judicial Activism:** Proactive role of judiciary in protecting rights and ensuring justice, especially when Legislature/Executive fail.
    *   Example: ***Hussainara Khatoon vs State of Bihar (1979)***
        *   Advocate Kapila Hingorani ("Mother of PIL") filed writ for undertrial prisoners in Bihar (many jailed longer than max sentence for their offence – violation of Art. 21).
        *   CJI P.N. Bhagwati treated a letter as a writ petition (Art. 32), issued Habeas Corpus.
        *   Over 35,000 undertrials freed.
        *   **Birth of PIL Revolution in India.** Made justice accessible for the voiceless.
        *   Shows judiciary stepping in when executive failed.
*   **Judicial Restraint:** Judiciary interferes but within constitutional limits, respecting roles of other organs. Avoids unnecessary intervention in policy unless clear violation of rights/law.

➡️ **THE KEY IS BALANCE** between activism (ensuring justice) and restraint (preserving institutional boundaries).

---

# ✍️ WRITS – Extraordinary Judicial Orders

Simple Meaning: **Order from a higher authority/court to a lower authority/court or state.**
(If order to individual, simply "order").

*   Called **PREROGATIVE WRITS** – entirely at the **discretion** of courts (extraordinary remedy).

📜 **Constitutional Provisions:**
*   **Article 32 (Supreme Court):**
    *   Right to move SC for enforcement of **Fundamental Rights (FRs)** is guaranteed.
    *   SC can issue writs for FR violation at 1st instance.
    *   Dr. Ambedkar called Art. 32 the "heart and soul" of the Constitution.
*   **Article 226 (High Courts):**
    *   HCs can issue writs for enforcement of **FRs AND for "any other purpose"** (i.e., other legal rights).
    *   HC writ jurisdiction is **WIDER** in scope than SC's.
    *   Territorially limited to HC's jurisdiction.
    *   Powers are **concurrent** with SC. (HC is not subordinate).

🚫 **Can SC issue a writ to HC? NO.** Writs travel top-down, and HC isn't subordinate to SC in this context.

## 🖐️ Five Types of Writs

🧠 **Mnemonic:** "I went to the **HQ** of **CPM** party" (or "Can He Marry Queen Properly?")
*   **H**abeas Corpus
*   **Q**uo Warranto
*   **C**ertiorari
*   **P**rohibition
*   **M**andamus

Writs are generally issued to the **State** or someone acting in the capacity of the State (e.g., private unaided schools governed by statutory provisions).

### 1. Habeas Corpus ("To have the body")
*   Purpose: To ensure release of a person **unlawfully detained**. Restores **LIBERTY** (violation of Art. 21).
*   Court orders detainer to bring detained person before it to check legality of detention.
*   If detention unlawful/arbitrary ➡️ immediate release.
*   Safeguard against illegal arrest, secret imprisonment, misuse of state power.
*   Can be issued against **State authorities AND private individuals** (e.g., human trafficking, private confinement).
*   **Locus Standi Relaxed:** Traditionally, only affected person could move court.
    *   In PIL & Habeas Corpus, any concerned person (advocate, NGO, friend) can approach SC/HC.
    *   ✅ **PIL, Habeas Corpus, Quo Warranto** are exceptions to strict Locus Standi.
    *   PIL: Filed by a concerned citizen in larger public interest. No locus standi asked.

### 2. Mandamus ("We command")
*   Purpose: To direct a **public official or authority** to perform a **mandatory public duty** they are legally bound to perform (constitutional, statutory, public nature).
*   Cannot be issued against private individuals.
*   Examples of Public Duty:
    *   Police to file FIR.
    *   Electricity Board (BSES) to supply electricity.
    *   Water Board (DJB) to supply water.
*   Procedure: Citizen complains to senior officer ➡️ If no action ➡️ File Mandamus in HC/SC.
*   Ensures accountable governance.

### 3. Prohibition ("To forbid" or "Stay Order")
*   Purpose: To **prevent a lower court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction** or acting against natural justice.
*   Issued **BEFORE** a final order is passed by the lower court/tribunal.
*   Stops proceedings where there's no jurisdiction or excess of jurisdiction.
*   Acts as **PREVENTION**.

### 4. Certiorari ("To be certified" or "To quash")
*   Purpose: To **quash an order already passed by a lower court, tribunal, or authority** if passed without jurisdiction, in excess of jurisdiction, or with an error of law apparent on the face of the record.
*   Issued **AFTER** a final order has been passed.
*   Provides a **CURE** for the wrong already done.

🤝 **Prohibition & Certiorari (Interlinked):**
*   Both deal with jurisdictional errors of lower courts/tribunals.
*   Prohibition = **Prevention** (before order)
*   Certiorari = **Cure** (after order)
*   🧠 Mnemonic: "Prevention is better than Cure"

### 5. Quo Warranto ("By what authority or warrant?")
*   Purpose: To inquire into the **legality of a person's claim to a public office** which they are not legally entitled to hold.
*   Restrains a person from holding such public office.
*   Example: Person appointed to IAS post with forged certificates.
*   Court issues writ asking: "By what authority are you holding this office?" (Show cause notice).
*   If person fails to justify ➡️ ordered to vacate. If satisfied ➡️ can continue.
*   **Locus Standi Relaxed:** Any interested person can seek this writ.
*   💼 **Case:** *Purushottam Lal vs State of Rajasthan* – QW filed against CM. Court rejected, stating issues with CM's election validity should be via election petition. However, if a Governor unconstitutionally appoints a non-qualified person as CM (Art. 164), that appointment could be challenged (though Governor has immunity under Art. 361 for actions).

## 🗓️ **Year 2017**

### 🔎 **Judicial Review**

**Q3. In India, Judicial Review implies**
**(a) the power of the Judiciary to pronounce upon the constitutionality of laws and executive orders.**
(b) the power of the Judiciary to question the wisdom of the laws enacted by the Legislatures.
(c) the power of the Judiciary to review all the legislative enactments before they are assented to by the President.
(d) the power of the Judiciary to review its own judgements given earlier in similar or different cases.

✅ **ANSWER: A**

**💬 Explanation:**
*   ***Judicial review*** is the power of the judiciary to examine the *constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders* of both the Central and state governments. On examination, if they are found to be violative of the Constitution (*ultra-vires*), they can be declared as illegal, unconstitutional and invalid (null and void). Consequently, they cannot be enforced by the government.
*   The constitutional validity of a legislative enactment or an executive order can be challenged in a high court or supreme court on the following three grounds: (a) it infringes the fundamental rights (Part III), (b) it is outside the competence of the authority which has framed it, and (c) it is repugnant to the constitutional provisions. Hence option (a) is the correct answer.

📚 **SOURCE:** Laxmikanth Ch-30 High Court

➕ **Additional Information:**
*   ***Article 13*** of the Indian Constitution describes the procedure for judicial review. It requires the Indian State to uphold and carry out fundamental rights. It also gives judges the authority to declare a law or other action invalid if it violates fundamental rights. The Supreme Court has declared the power of judicial review as a ***basic feature of the Constitution*** or an element of the basic structure of the Constitution.

## 🗓️ **Year 2019**

### 🏛️ **Supreme Court**

**Q4. With reference to the Constitution of India, prohibition or limitations or provisions contained in ordinary laws cannot act as prohibitions or limitations on the constitutional powers under *Article 142*. It could mean which one of the following?**
(a) The decisions taken by the Election Commission of India while discharging its duties cannot be challenged in any court of law.
**(b) The Supreme Court of India is not constrained in the exercise of its powers by laws made by the Parliament.**
(c) In the event of grave financial crisis in the country, the President of India can declare Financial Emergency without the counsel from the Cabinet.
(d) State Legislatures cannot make laws on certain matters without the concurrence of Union Legislature.

✅ **ANSWER: B**

**💬 Explanation:**
*   ***Article 142*** states that the Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing ***complete justice*** in any cause or matter pending before it.
*   Any decree so passed or orders so made shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India in such manner as may be prescribed by Parliament.
*   Until a provision in that behalf is made, then it would be enforced in such a manner as the President may by order prescribe. One of the important instances of application by the Supreme Court of Article 142 was in the ***Union Carbide case*** – relating to the victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy.
*   In this judgment, the Supreme Court, while awarding compensation of $470 million to the victims, went to the extent of saying that to do complete justice, it could even override the laws made by Parliament by holding that, *“prohibitions or limitations or provisions contained in ordinary laws cannot, ipso facto, act as prohibitions or limitations on the constitutional powers under Article 142."* By this statement the Supreme Court of India placed itself above the laws made by Parliament or the legislatures of the States. Hence the Supreme Court of India is not constrained in the exercise of its powers by laws made by the Parliament.

✨ **Some important cases where Supreme Court invoked *Article 142* are:**
1.  Appointment of Lokayukta in Uttar Pradesh.
2.  Setting up R.M. Lodha Committee to oversee the functioning of the Medical Council of India (MCI).
3.  Transfer the trial of accused in Babri Masjid demolition case.
4.  Ban on sale of alcohol within 500 meters of state and national highways.
5.  Witness Protection Scheme, 2018

🎯 **Elimination strategy:**
*   The Indian constitution provides for a provision of the Supreme Court under ***Part V (The Union)***. ***Articles 124 to 147*** in Part V of the Constitution deal with the organisation, independence, jurisdiction, powers and procedures of the Supreme Court.

### 🏛️ **Supreme Court**

**Q5. Consider the following statements:**
1.  The motion to impeach a Judge of the Supreme Court of Indian cannot be rejected by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha as per the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968.

3.  The details of the process of impeachment of the Judges of the Supreme Court of India are given in the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968.
4.  If the motion for the impeachment of a Judge is taken up for voting, the law requires the motion to be backed by each House of the Parliament and supported by a majority of total membership of that House and by not less than two-thirds of total members of that House present and voting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
**(c) 3 and 4 only**
(d) 1, 3 and 4

✅ **ANSWER: C**

**💬 Explanation:**
*   A judge may be removed from office through a motion adopted by Parliament on grounds of ***'proven misbehaviour or incapacity'***. While the Constitution does not use the word 'impeachment', it is colloquially used to refer to the proceedings under ***Article 124*** (for the removal of a Supreme Court judge) and ***Article 218*** (for the removal of a High Court judge).
*   The ***Judges Enquiry Act (1968)*** regulates the procedure relating to the removal of a judge of the Supreme Court by the process of impeachment. (Statement 3 is correct)

🛡️ **Impeachment Proceedings:**
*   A removal motion signed by **100 members (in CASE of Lok Sabha)** or **50 members (in case of Rajya Sabha)** is to be given to the Speaker/Chairman.
    *   *Statement 1 is incorrect as the Speaker/Chairman can admit or refuse to admit the motion.*
*   If the motion is admitted, then a three-member committee (consisting of a Supreme Court judge, a chief justice at high court and a distinguished jurist to investigate into the charges is constituted.
*   If the committee finds the judge to be guilty of the charges (misbehavior of incapacity), the house in which the motion was introduced, can take consideration of the motion.
    *   *Statement 2 is incorrect as the Constitution does not define 'incapacity and proved misbehaviour'.*

🗳️ **Special majority:** Majority of total membership of the house & Majority of not less than two-third members present and voting.
*   Once, the House in which removal motion was introduced passes it with special majority it goes to the second house which also has to pass it with a special majority. (Statement 4 is correct)
*   After the motion is passed, an address is presented to the President for removal of the judge. The President then passes an order removing the judge.

## 🗓️ **Year 2020**

### ⚖️ **NALSA (National Legal Services Authority)**

**Q6. In India, Legal Services Authorities provide free legal services to which of the following type of citizens?**
1.  Person with an annual income of less than ₹1,00,000
2.  Transgender with an annual income of less than ₹2,00,000
3.  Member of Other Backward Classes (OBC) with an annual income of less than ₹3,00,000
4.  All Senior Citizens

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
**(a) 1 and 2 only**
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

✅ **ANSWER: A**

**💬 Explanation:**
As per the ***Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987***, following are entitled to free legal services:
*Provisions for providing legal service– Every person who has to file or defend a suit shall be entitled to legal service under this Act, if such person–*
(a) is a member of a **Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe**.
(b) is a victim of **human trafficking or forced labour** as referred to in article 23 of the Constitution.
(c) is a **woman or child**.
(d) is a **person with disability** as defined in clause (t) of section 2 of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Rights, Protection and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (1 of 1996).
(e) is a person subject to conditions of **undeserved deprivation**. For example, is a victim of disaster, caste violence, caste atrocity, flood, drought, earthquake or industrial crisis.
(f) is an **industrial worker**.
(g) is in **custody in a protection home**.
(h) persons having an **annual income of less than a specified amount**.

*   The Income Ceiling Limit prescribed u/S 12(h) of the Act for availing free legal services in different States. For most of the states NALSA have included people whose Annual income does not exceed **₹1 lakh**. Hence **option 1 is correct.**
*   Senior Citizen - Senior citizens' eligibility for free legal aid depends on the Rules framed by the respective State Governments in this regard. Further, Free legal services are **not available to all senior citizens.** Hence **option 4 is not correct.**
*   Transgender (Annual income less than **₹2 Lac**) in Delhi. Hence **option 2 is correct.**

📝 **Note:**
*   Statement 3 is not correct as there is **no such provision for OBC** specifically mentioned for automatic eligibility based on community alone; income criteria would apply as per point (h).

*   📜 ***Article 215:*** Every High Court shall be a **court of record** and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself. UPSC in its official answer key gave statement 2 as incorrect as no specific power has been given to High Court by the constitution to review its judgement. Hence **statement 2 is not correct** (as per UPSC key's reasoning, though judicial interpretation might differ).
*   However, as per ***Pottakalathil Ramakrishnan v. Thahsildar, Tirur &ors***, it was stated that as a court of record, a High Court in India has the power to review its own judgement. *(This indicates a nuance not fully captured by the direct constitutional text but emerging from judicial interpretation).*

## 🗓️ **Year 2022**

### 🏛️ **Supreme Court**

**Q8. Consider the following statements:**
1.  Pursuant to the report of H.N. Sanyal Committee, the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 was passed.
2.  The Constitution of India empowers the Supreme Court and the High Courts to punish for contempt of themselves.
3.  The Constitution of India defines Civil Contempt and Criminal Contempt.
4.  In India, the Parliament is vested with the powers to make laws on Contempt of Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
**(b) 1, 2 and 4**
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 only

✅ **ANSWER: B**

**💬 Explanation:**
*   **Statement 1 is correct:** A committee was set up in 1961 under the chairmanship of the late **H N Sanyal**, the then additional solicitor general. The committee made a comprehensive examination of the law and problems relating to contempt of court... The recommendations, which the committee made, took note of the importance given to freedom of speech in the Constitution and of the need for safeguarding the status and dignity of courts and interests of administration of justice. The ***Contempt of Courts Act, 1971*** was passed based on this.
*   **Statement 2 is correct:** ***Article 129*** of the Constitution gives the Supreme Court the power to initiate contempt cases on its own (suo motu), independent of the motion brought before it by the Attorney General (AG) or with the consent of the AG. Similarly, ***Article 215*** confers this power on High Courts.
*   **Statement 3 is not correct and Statement 4 is correct:** Contempt of court seeks to protect judicial institutions from motivated attacks and unwarranted criticism... The expression ***'contempt of court' has not been defined by the Constitution.*** The ***Contempt of Court Act, 1971 defines both civil and criminal contempt.*** Hence the **Parliament is vested with the powers to make laws regarding contempt of court.**

🎯 **Elimination strategy:**
*   Arbitrary invoke of contempt powers by courts due to lack of proper definition of civil and criminal contempt in the Constitution is widely covered in the news.

## 🗓️ **Miscellaneous**

**Q9. With reference to India, consider the following statements:**
1.  Government law officers and legal firms are recognised as advocates, but corporate lawyers and patent attorneys are excluded from recognition as advocates.
2.  Bar Councils have the power to lay down the rules relating to legal education and recognition of law colleges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
**(b) 2 only**
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

✅ **ANSWER: B**

**💬 Explanation:**
*   The role of the legal profession in society is manifold—its members are flag-bearers of the rule of law and they defend fundamental rights. Along with these responsibilities, members of the legal profession have been conferred significant power and privileges as officers of the court. First, **only advocates have the right to access and represent others in a court of law.** No citizen, other than an advocate, has the right to appear, act, or plead in court. Second, in India, the term “legal professionals" refers only to those “advocates" who are law graduates and have been enrolled in state bar councils (SBCs).
*   **Statement 1 is not correct:** An emerging class of legal professionals engaged with various law-related activities—such as government law officers, corporate lawyers, law firms, law professors, legal researchers, and patent attorneys—have been **excluded from recognition as advocates** *if they are not enrolled with Bar Councils and do not meet the criteria of "practicing law" as defined (which can be restrictive for full-time salaried employees like corporate lawyers not appearing in courts).* The statement implies a blanket recognition for legal firms as advocates which is not entirely how individual advocates within firms are recognized. The core issue is individual enrollment and adherence to Bar Council rules. *The nuance is that while individuals in these roles might be law graduates, their full-time employment in non-litigious roles or specific corporate settings can affect their status as "advocates" in the traditional sense of practicing before courts.*
*   Third, the judiciary has clarified the otherwise undefined concept of “practice of law” to include all forms of legal activities, including both litigious and non-litigious work, such as appearing in court, drafting, giving opinions, performing transactional work, consulting, arbitrating, mediating, filing vakalatnamas (power of attorney), and working as legal officers. Thus, “advocates" enrolled in bar councils enjoy exclusive monopoly over the right to practise law in all courts, tribunals, and other authorities in India.
*   **Statement 2 is correct:** The ***Advocates Act, 1961***, enacted with the objective of creating “a unified Bar for the whole country with monopoly in legal practice and autonomy in matters of professional management,” conferred the **Bar Council of India (BCI) and SBCs with the power to self-regulate the profession and lay down rules** relating to admission and enrolment, conditions of practice, standards of professional conduct and etiquette, disciplinary proceedings, ***legal education, recognition of law colleges***, and welfare activities. These powers were granted to the bar councils to promote the administration of justice and uphold the dignity of the profession in the eyes of the common people.
