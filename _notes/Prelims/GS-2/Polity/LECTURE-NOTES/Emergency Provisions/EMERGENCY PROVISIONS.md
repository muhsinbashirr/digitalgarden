## 🏛️ EMERGENCY PROVISIONS IN INDIA (PART XVIII)

A democratic country is wary of power concentration, and Emergency Provisions inherently lead to it.

- **❓ Why have them?** They are a **NECESSARY EVIL** 😈.
    
- **Normal State:** Federation (Distribution of Powers: Union, State, Concurrent Lists).
    
- **Emergency State:** Federal structure temporarily shifts to **UNITARY** (Concentration of power in Central Government).
    
    - This is a huge risk but necessary in certain conditions.
        
- 📜 **Constitutional Basis:** [[PART 18 OF THE CONSTITUTION]]
    
    - Articles: [[Article 352]], [[Article 353]], [[Article 354]], [[Article 355]], [[Article 356]], [[Article 357]], [[Article 358]], [[Article 359]], [[Article 360]].
        
    - Designed for a temporary period to convert Federation to a centralized/unitary one.

### 🌍 Understanding Emergency Provisions: Lessons from History

🔴 **Backdrop: Germany after World War I (1919–1933)**

- **1919 – Treaty of Versailles:**
    
    - Germany lost WWI, forced to accept guilt, pay reparations, surrender territory.
        
    - Felt insulted 😤, led to economic damages 💰, socio-economic chaos (inflation, unemployment, political instability).  
        ⚫ **Weimar Republic & [[Article 48]]**
        
- Constitution of Weimar Republic (1919–1933) contained [[Article 48]] (emergency provision).
    
    - 🛑 Allowed President to take emergency actions without Parliament’s (Reichstag) consent.
        
    - Could issue emergency decrees, suspend fundamental rights.
        
    - Intended for temporary, exceptional situations.  
        ⚠️ **How Hitler Exploited the Crisis**
        
- 🕵️‍♂️ Hitler used economic despair and public anger.
    
- **1933 – Reichstag Fire:**
    
    - German Parliament burned down.
        
    - Hitler blamed communists, called it a "Terror Attack."
        
    - Convinced President Hindenburg to invoke [[Article 48]].
        
    - Suspended fundamental rights, banned press, arrested opposition.  
        🧨 **The Enabling Act (1933)**
        
- Passed through Parliament in an atmosphere of fear.
    
- Gave Hitler full legislative powers, bypassing Reichstag and President.
    
- **Led to:**
    
    - 📌 Concentration of power
        
    - ❌ End of democratic checks
        
    - 🔥 Suppression of dissent
        
    - ☠️ Holocaust & World War II
        

🇮🇳 **India’s Learning: Constitution & Emergency Provisions**

- 🗓️ **9th December 1946 – First Meeting of Constituent Assembly.**
    
- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, aware of Germany's experience, took a cautious, balanced approach.
    
- 📜 **Part XVIII of the Indian Constitution: Emergency Provisions**
    
    - [[Article 352]]: National Emergency (war, external/internal aggression)
        
    - [[Article 356]]: President's Rule (failure of constitutional machinery in states)
        
    - [[Article 360]]: Financial Emergency
        
- 🛡️ **Key Point: Ambedkar:** "I won’t just give Emergency Provisions, I’ll also give Constitutional Safeguards."
    
    - Emergency = necessary in some cases (e.g., war).
        
    - But must not turn into dictatorship.
        
    - **Hence, checks & balances in India:**
        
        - Parliamentary approval needed.
            
        - Judicial review possible.
            
        - Time-limited use.
            

W🧠 **Mnemonic for Emergency Articles:**

- Start with **352**
    
- Add **4** → **356**
    
- Add **4** → **360**

### 1️⃣ [[Article 352]] - NATIONAL EMERGENCY 🚨

📜 **352. Proclamation of Emergency**  
(1) If the President is satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened, whether by **war** or **external aggression** or **armed rebellion**, he may, by Proclamation, made a declaration to that effect...

- ⚡ **[[44TH CAA, 1978]]**: Changed ‘INTERNAL DISTURBANCE’ to **‘ARMED REBELLION’**.
    
- **Who Proclaims?** President 🧑‍⚖️.
    
- **Grounds?** War, External Aggression, Armed Rebellion.
    
- **Scope of Threat:**
    
    - 🅰️ India as a whole
        
    - 🅱️ Part of India
        
    - ➡️ (✓) Either A or B (as per [[42ND CAA, 1976]]).
        
- **Timing:** Proclamation can be made before actual occurrence if President is satisfied of imminent danger thereof.
    

W🧠 **Mnemonic for Key Amendments:**

1. **[[42ND CAA, 1976]]** - Indira Gandhi (Trick: 4+2 = 6 → 197**6**)
    
2. **[[44TH CAA, 1978]]** - Morarji Desai (Trick: 4+4 = 8 → 197**8**)
    

🗣️ **Whose Satisfaction?**

- Not President’s personal satisfaction.
    
- It's the satisfaction of the **Union Council of Ministers (UCoM) headed by PM**.
    
- ⚖️ **SC Ruling:** Not a discretionary power; President is bound by Union Cabinet advice ([[Article 74]]).
    

📋 **Procedure for Proclamation of Emergency:**

1. 📌 **PROCLAMATION:** Advice by PM + CoM → President issues it.
    
    - [[44TH CAA, 1978]] mandates **WRITTEN advice** of the full Cabinet.
        
2. 📍 **Within 30 days:** Legislative approval by **both Houses of Parliament** (Lok Sabha & Rajya Sabha).
    
3. ⚙️ **Majority Required:** Special Majority (Post-[[44TH CAA, 1978]]; previously Simple Majority).
    
    - 2/3rd of present and voting.
        
    - & Absolute Majority of total membership.
        
    - Applies to both Houses independently.
        
4. 📍 Legislative approval extends Emergency by **6 months**.
    
5. 📍 Before end of every 6 months → Need legislative approval again (same special majority) to extend by another 6 months.
    
6. 📍 Can continue for **indefinite time** if timely approval continues.
    

🇮🇳 **National Emergencies in INDIA till now:**

1. **1962 - 1968:** India-China War (Chinese aggression in NEFA) → External Aggression.
    
2. **1971 - 1977:** Indo-Pakistan War → External Aggression.
    
3. **1975 - 1977:** INTERNAL DISTURBANCE.

#### Internal Emergency (1975–1977) – The Darkest Hour 🌑

🛑 **Key Events & Actions Taken:**

1. **Press Censorship:**
    
    - Media shut down or heavily censored. Free press suspended.
        
    - The Indian Express printed a blank editorial in protest.
        
2. **Preventive Arrests – MISA Act, 1971:**
    
    - Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) used extensively.
        
    - Thousands arrested without trial (opposition leaders, activists, students).
        
3. **Total Executive Overreach:**
    
    - President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed signed Proclamation at midnight (25th June 1975).
        
    - He did **not consult the Cabinet**; Ministers informed hours later (violating collective responsibility).
        

⚖️ **Constitutional Violations & Legal Engineering:**

1. **Ignored Safeguards in [[Article 352]]:**
    
    - President signed first, Cabinet resolution passed later. (This led to [[Article 352]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=3) requiring written Cabinet advice via [[44TH CAA, 1978]]).
        
2. **Retrospective Cover-up – [[38TH CAA, 1975]]:**
    
    - Allowed President to issue different types of Emergency Proclamations.
        
    - Made President's satisfaction final and conclusive, not subject to judicial review (later struck down).
        
    - Applied retrospectively to legalize the Emergency.
        
3. **Multiple Emergencies in Effect:**
    
    - 1971 Indo-Pak War Emergency was already in force.
        
    - 1975 Emergency (internal disturbance) created a dual-emergency.

| Violation of Const. Morality  | Ignoring Cabinet advice, centralizing power.           |
| Misuse of Presidential Powers | President as rubber stamp.                             |
| Judiciary’s Weakness          | Initially failed to uphold rights (ADM Jabalpur Case). |
| Need for Safeguards           | Led to *44TH CAA, 1978* to prevent future misuse.      |
| Resilience of Democracy       | People overthrew authoritarianism in 1977.             |

🌅 **Unexpected End of Emergency**

- **21st March 1977:** Emergency suddenly revoked.
    
- Reasons unclear (miscalculation of popularity?).
    
- Indira Gandhi called for elections → Major defeat.
    
- Janata Party won; Morarji Desai became India’s first non-Congress PM.

2. Notice to: President (if LS not in session) or Speaker (if LS in session).
    
3. Special sitting within 14 days.
    
4. Simple Majority passes revocation motion.
    
5. Emergency is revoked ✅.
    

⚖️ **Judicial Review: Minerva Mills Case (1980)**

- 👨‍⚖️ Nani Palkhiwala argued.
    
- **SC Held:**
    
    - Emergency proclamation **can be challenged** in court on grounds of:
        
        - Malafide intention.
            
        - Based on irrelevant or extraneous facts.
            
    - 📌 Struck down [[38TH CAA, 1975]] provision making Emergency immune to judicial review.
        
    - 📌 Reasserted: "Everything in India is under Judicial Review".
        

✍️ **Summary: Why Article 352 Matters Today**

- 1975–77 Emergency exposed misuse potential.
    
- Taught importance of safeguards, judicial checks, FRs.
    
- [[44TH CAA, 1978]] ensured future Emergencies are:
    
    - Narrow in scope.
        
    - Cabinet-accountable.
        
    - Revocable by Parliament.
        
    - Judicially reviewable ✅.

#### प्रभाव (Effects) of National Emergency ([[Article 352]])

Federal structure temporarily converts to **Unitary**.

- **❓ Why power to Centre?** Due to [[Article 355]].
    

📜 **[[Article 355]]: Duty of the Union**

- "It shall be the duty of the Union to protect every State against external aggression and internal disturbance and to ensure that the government of every State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution."
    

➡️ **Effect on Centre-State Relations ([[Article 353]] & [[Article 354]])**  
Broadly on: Executive, Legislative, Financial.

🔵 **1. Executive ([[Article 353]])**

- Executive power of Union extends to giving directions to any State on how its executive power is exercised.
    
- **State Govt. is NOT suspended** but works according to Union Govt. directions.
    

🟢 **2. Legislative ([[Article 353]])**

- Parliament can make laws on any matter in the **State List**. (Read with [[Article 250]])
    
    - Safeguard: If Parliament makes law on State List (under Art 250 route generally), it requires a resolution from Rajya Sabha. (This specific RS resolution for Art 250 is for normal times, during emergency under 353, Parliament's power is broader).
        
- **State Legislature is NOT suspended** but Union Parliament can 'override' it.
    
- President can issue Ordinances on matters of ‘State List’.
    
- Laws made by Parliament on State List during emergency cease to operate **6 months after** emergency ceases.
    
- Summary: Federation acts like unitary. State Govt. NOT dissolved, but overpowered.
    

🔴 **3. Financial ([[Article 354]])**

- President may, by order, direct that provisions of [[Article 268]] to [[Article 279]] (distribution of revenues) shall be modified.
    
- This arrangement works till the end of the Financial Year (F.Y.) in which emergency ceases.
    
- Centre can alter financial arrangements with states.
    

---

#### Impact of Emergency on Fundamental Rights (FRs) - [[Article 358]] & [[Article 359]]

🔵 **[[Article 358]]: Suspension of [[Article 19]] provisions**

- While a Proclamation of Emergency due to **WAR** or **EXTERNAL AGGRESSION** is in operation:
    
    - [[Article 19]] is **automatically suspended**.
        
    - State can make laws or take executive actions abridging [[Article 19]].
        
    - Such laws cease to have effect post-emergency (except for things done/omitted).
        
- 🔑 **Important (Post-[[44TH CAA, 1978]]):** [[Article 19]] is NOT suspended if emergency is declared on ground of **ARMED REBELLION** (Internal Emergency).
    

🔴 **[[Article 359]]: Suspension of enforcement of other FRs**

- When Emergency is in operation, President may by **ORDER** declare that the right to move any court for enforcement of specified FRs (mentioned in the order) shall be suspended.
    
- This applies to proceedings pending in court too.
    
- Suspension is for the period of emergency or a shorter specified period.
    
- ✅ **Crucial Safeguard ([[44TH CAA, 1978]]):** [[Article 20]] (Protection in respect of conviction for offences) & [[Article 21]] (Protection of life and personal liberty) **CANNOT be suspended** even during an emergency.
    
- Suspension is of **enforcement**, not the FRs themselves. You can't approach SC/HC via [[Article 32]]/[[Article 226]] for those specified FRs.
    

❓ **Question:** Which FRs will never be mentioned in the President's order under [[Article 359]] for suspension of enforcement?

- **Answer:** [[Article 20]], [[Article 21]]. (And [[Article 19]] is not suspended by order under 359; it's either auto-suspended under 358 or not suspended at all).
    

💡 **Concept of SUSPENSION:**

- [[Article 13]]: Laws violating FRs are void (subject to judicial review).
    
- [[Article 358]] & [[Article 359]] allow temporary deviation.
    
    - [[Article 358]]: Automatic suspension of [[Article 19]] (for War/Ext. Aggression).
        
    - [[Article 359]]: President's order suspends enforcement of other specified FRs.
        
    - This means denial of access to courts (remedy) for those FRs.
        

---

#### Post-Emergency Scenario & Legislature Terms

- **Laws made by Parliament on State List:** Continue for **6 months** after emergency revoked, unless state continues them.
    
- **Term of Legislatures:**
    
    - Lok Sabha ([[Article 83]]) & State Legislative Assemblies ([[Article 172]]) can have their terms extended by law during emergency.
        
    - Extension: Not beyond 1 year at a time.
        
    - In no case beyond 6 months after emergency ends.
        
- **Ratification if Lok Sabha Dissolved:**
    
    - If LS dissolved or not constituted when proclamation issued:
        
        - Rajya Sabha approval is sufficient temporarily.
            
        - Once LS reconstituted, it must approve within **30 days**.

### 2️⃣ [[Article 356]] – PRESIDENT'S RULE (State Emergency) 🧑‍⚖️

- Popularly known as "President's Rule," though this term isn't in the Constitution.  
    📜 **356. Provisions in case of failure of constitutional machinery in State**  
    (1) If the President (on advice of UCoM + PM), on receipt of a **report from the Governor** of the State or **otherwise**, is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with ... this Constitution, the President may by Proclamation...
    
- **Comparison:** [[Article 356]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=1) is less detailed than [[Article 352]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=1). Seems more relaxed.
    
- **Ambedkar's View:** Thought it would be a **"DEAD LETTER"** (written but rarely used).
    
- **Reality:** Became highly misused, a **POLITICAL WEAPON** ⚔️.
    
    - Used over **125+ times**. PM Indira Gandhi: ~50 times.
        
    - **First Use:** 20 June 1951, Punjab.
        

📋 **How President's Rule is Implemented:**

1. 🔻 **PROCLAMATION:** (PM + UCoM advice to President)
    
    - Based on Governor's report OR "otherwise".
        
    - President's Rule active for next 2 months initially.
        
2. 🔻 **WITHIN 60 DAYS (2 months):** Legislative approval by **both Houses of Parliament** (LS & RS separately).
    
    - Majority: **SIMPLE MAJORITY** (present and voting).
        
3. 🔻 Legislative approval extends President's Rule by **6 MONTHS**.
    
4. 🔻 Before end of 6 months: Legislative approval to extend by **6 MORE MONTHS**.
    
5. 🧸 **MAXIMUM DURATION:** **3 YEARS**.
    

✅ **Conditions for Extending President's Rule Beyond 1 Year ([[44TH CAA, 1978]]):**  
BOTH conditions must be met:

- **(a)** A Proclamation of National Emergency ([[Article 352]]) is in operation (in whole of India, or whole/part of the State).  
    **AND**
    
- **(b)** The Election Commission certifies that continuing President's Rule is necessary due to difficulties in holding general elections to the State Legislative Assembly.
    
- ➡️ Most President's Rule instances end within 1 year due to these strict conditions.
    

---

#### Effects of President's Rule ([[Article 356]])

- ✅ **NO EFFECT ON:** Fundamental Rights & Judiciary.
    
- **Focus:** Executive, Legislative relations.
    

**Why "President's Rule"?**

- President assumes executive functions of the State Govt (exercised via Governor).
    
- Powers of State Legislature become exercisable by/under authority of Parliament.
    
- Parliament may delegate law-making power for the state to the President.
    
- Essentially, State Executive & Legislature lose powers to the Union.
    

**The PRESIDENT may:**

- **(a)** Assume all/any functions of State Govt & powers of Governor (excluding State Legislature).
    
- **(b)** Declare powers of State Legislature exercisable by/under Parliament.
    
- **(c)** Make incidental/consequential provisions.
    
- State government run by Centre via Governor & bureaucrats, not elected reps.
    
- 🔄 **REVOCATION:** Any such proclamation may be revoked or varied by a subsequent proclamation.
    

---

🛑 **Misuse of [[Article 356]]: Then vs. Now**

- **Early Years:** Often misused by Union to dismiss elected state governments.
    
- **SC's Early Stance (1970s):** Passive. Refused to interfere (political decisions, not justiciable).
    
    - This allowed widespread misuse.
        

🧑‍⚖️ **Turning Point: S.R. Bommai Case (1994)**

- **Case Facts:** S.R. Bommai (CM of Karnataka) claimed majority. Governor Venkatasubbiah recommended dismissal without floor test. President imposed Rule.
    
- **Landmark Judgment (9-judge bench):**
    
    - ✅ President’s power under [[Article 356]] is **NOT absolute**; subject to **JUDICIAL REVIEW**.
        
    - 🧠 Misuse of [[Article 356]] affects federal structure (Basic Feature).
        
- **Key Principles Laid Down:**
    
    1. Majority must be tested on the **floor of the House**.
        
    2. President’s Rule can be reviewed by courts.
        
    3. Centre’s power not immune to judicial scrutiny.
        
    4. Misuse = Violation of federalism = Unconstitutional.
        
    5. SC can reinstate dismissed government if proclamation unconstitutional.
        

🟨 **Bommai Guidelines ([[Article 356]] Control Mechanism):**

1. ✅ **Objective Grounds Required:** Use sparingly to maintain federal balance.
    
2. ❌ **No Pre-Approval Dissolution:** State Assembly cannot be dissolved before both Houses approve proclamation. (Can be kept in suspended animation).
    
3. ⚖️ **Judicial Review Allowed:** Courts can examine if real grounds existed (HC under [[Article 226]], SC under [[Article 32]]). Burden of proof on Union.
    
4. 📂 **Govt Must Submit Records:** Courts can demand material/advice.
    
5. 🛑 **Stay Possible:** Courts can issue temporary stay.
    
6. 🔁 **Revival of Govt:** If unconstitutional, courts can reinstate dismissed govt & State Assembly.
    

📉 **Impact of Bommai Judgment:**

- Instances of President’s Rule **reduced significantly**.
    
    - Jan 1950 - Mar 1994: ~100 times (Avg: 2.5/year).
        
    - 1995 - 2021: ~29 times (Avg: >1/year).
        
- **Key Takeaways from S.R. Bommai Case:**
    
    - [[Article 356]] for exceptional situations, not political purposes.
        
    - Decisions subject to Judicial Review.
        
    - 🕊️ **Secularism** declared a basic feature.
        

🛣️ **Paths to [[Article 356]]:**
