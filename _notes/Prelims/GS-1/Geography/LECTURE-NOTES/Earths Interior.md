**🌍** **Physical Geography - Lithosphere, Biosphere and Hydrosphere**  
  

**LITHOSPHERE**

The term "lithosphere" comes from the Greek word litho, which means "stone," OR rock and "sphere," referring to the rough shape of the Earth

**INTERIOR OF THE EARTH**

This is a **layered structure of Earth**:

---

**🧱** **1. Crust (Outermost layer):**

- **Continental Crust**: Made of **SIAL** (Silica + Aluminium), thicker.
- **Oceanic Crust**: Made of **SIMA** (Silica + Magnesium), thinner.
- **Thickness**: ~34 km (varies).
- **Continental crust is thicker than the ocean crust**
- **Covers less than 1% of the earths volume**

---

**🔥** **2. Mantle (Middle Layer):**

- Composed primarily of **SIMA**.
- Extends up to **2900 km** deep.
- This is the **thickest layer** (~84% of Earth's volume).
- Involved in **plate tectonics, magma movement, convection currents**.

---

**💥** **3. Core (Innermost Layer):**

- Composed of **NIFE** (Nickel + Iron).
- Divided into:

- **Outer Core** (liquid)
- **Inner Core** (solid)

- Extends from 2900 km to **6371 km** depth.
- 13-14% EARTHS VOLUME

MANTLE > CORE >CRUST

**🌍** **Why is Earth's Interior So Hot & How Does Lava Form?**

**🔥** **Source of Earth's Internal Heat**

The Earth is extremely hot beneath the surface — **hot enough to melt rocks** and form **magma**, which erupts as **lava** during volcanic activity.

So, the natural question is: **Why is it so hot deep inside?**

**✅** **Causes of High Temperature:**

1. ☢️ **Radioactive Decay**

- Elements like **Uranium, Thorium, and Potassium-40** decay inside Earth.
- This decay **releases heat continuously** — the **main reason** for high internal temperatures.

3. 🔥 **Residual Heat** (Primordial Heat)

- Leftover heat from Earth's **formation ~4.6 billion years ago**, when meteors collided and compressed the planet.

5. 💥 **Gravitational Compression (Adiabatic Heating)**

- As materials move inward due to gravity, **pressure increases**, causing the interior to heat up.

---

**🌡️** **How Much Does the Temperature Increase?**

- Known as the **Geothermal Gradient**.
- **For every 32 meters**, temperature rises by **~1°C**.
- So, at a depth of **~100 km**, you’ll reach **extremely hot, partially molten rock**.

---

**🧱** **Earth’s Interior Layers: Structure & Behavior**

**1️****⃣** **LITHOSPHERE (0–100 km)**

- **Solid rock layer** made up of:

- 🧱 **Crust** (oceanic & continental)
- 🔸 Little of **Uppermost mantle**

- Hard, rigid, and brittle.
- Composition SIAL/SIMA
- Forms **tectonic plates** that float on the asthenosphere.
- **Thickness** varies: 5–10 km (oceanic) to 30–70 km (continental)

---

**2️****⃣** **ASTHENOSPHERE (100–700 km)**

- Lies **just below lithosphere**
- **Upper mantle**
- **Composition SIMA**
- **Hot and under high pressure**, so:

- Rock is in **semi-solid/plastic** form
- Known as a "**soft, mobile zone**"

- 💨 Due to **convection currents** in this layer:

- Plates above **move**, causing **earthquakes, volcanic eruptions**
- Semi-solid rock **flows slowly**

**❗****Why lava is solid inside and liquid outside?**

- Deep inside, rock is **semi-solid** because **pressure keeps it compressed**
- Once it **erupts** and **pressure is released**, it becomes **fully molten (liquid lava)**

---

**3️****⃣** **Mesosphere - (700–2900 km)**

- Also made of silicate rocks, but it’s more **rigid and solid** than asthenosphere.
- Composition SIMA
- Lower mantle
- Why?

- 🔒 **Enormous pressure** increases rock strength despite the heat.

---

**4️****⃣** **CORE (2900–6371 km)**

Divided into two parts:

**🔸** **A. Outer Core (2900–5100 km)**

- **Liquid** state
- Made of **Nickel + Iron (NiFe)**
- 🌐 Flow of liquid metal here creates **Earth’s magnetic field**
- Even under high pressure, it's molten due to:

- **Low melting point of NiFe**
- Intense **internal heat**

**🔸** **B. Inner Core (5100–6371 km)**

- **Solid**, even hotter than outer core
- Same composition (NiFe), but **much higher pressure** compresses it into a **rigid solid**
- 🔁 Solid due to:

- **Pressure > Melting point**
- "Solidification under pressure"

---

**❓** **Why same composition but different states in outer and inner core?**

- Both have **Ni + Fe** (low melting metals)
- 🌡️ **Outer core** is **less pressured**, so metals are in **liquid state**
- ⚙️ **Inner core** has **tremendous pressure**, which forces matter into a **solid state**
- 🌀 Also, in a rotating fluid system:

- **Denser solids sink**
- **Liquids rise**, creating **layered structure**

**🌍** **How Do We Know About Earth's Interior?**

**🔹** **Direct Sources (Limited Reach)**

- **Drilling**:

- Deepest = **Kola borehole (12 km)**, Russia

- **Mining**:

- **Mponeng & TauTona Mines**, ~3.9 km deep

- **Volcanic Eruption**:

- Brings magma from inside, but depth unknown  
    🔸 **Limitation**: Can't go beyond shallow crust.

---

**🔹** **Indirect Sources (Most Reliable)**

- **Seismic Waves**:

- P & S waves reveal internal layers

- **Meteorites**:

- Formed from same nebula as Earth

- **Gravity Variation**:

- Stronger at poles, weaker at equator

- **Magnetic Field**:

**🌍** **Earthquake: Clue to Earth's Interior**

**✅** **Why Study Earthquakes?**

Earthquakes provide **indirect evidence** about Earth’s interior through **seismic waves**. These waves behave differently across layers, helping map the crust, mantle, and core.

---

**🌐** **What is an Earthquake?**

An **earthquake** is the **sudden shaking** of the Earth’s surface due to the **release of energy** in the lithosphere. This energy travels as **seismic waves**.

**🧱** **Cause:**

🔁 **Asthenosphere convection currents** → disturbs **lithospheric plates** → sudden slip → earthquake!

---

**🔹** **Terminologies:**

|**Term**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|
|**Focus** (Hypocentre)|Point **inside the Earth** where the energy is released.|
|**Epicentre**|Point **on the surface** just above the focus. First to feel tremors.|

---

**🌊** **Seismic Waves = Earthquake Waves**

Seismic waves are like **ripples in water** when a stone is thrown. There are **2 main types**:

---

**🌀** **1. Body Waves (Travel inside Earth)**

|**Wave Type**|**Full Form**|**Nature**|**Speed**|**Medium**|**Motion Type**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**P-Waves**|Primary Waves|Longitudinal|5–8 km/sec|Solid, Liquid, Gas|➡️ Compression + Expansion|
|**S-Waves**|Secondary Waves|Transverse|4–5 km/sec|Only Solid|⬆️ Crest + Trough|

📌 **Key Differences:**

|**Feature**|**P-Waves**|**S-Waves**|
|---|---|---|
|Arrival|First to arrive|Second to arrive|
|Direction|Parallel to motion|Perpendicular to motion|
|Speed|Faster (5–8 km/s)|Slower (~4–5 km/s)|
|Medium|Solid, Liquid, Gas|Only Solid|
|Wave Motion|Compression & Rarefaction|Up & down (like light/water)|
|Other Name|Pressure Wave|Shear Wave|
|Impact|Displaces rocks completely|Cannot pass through liquid|

---

**❓** **Why P-Waves Travel Through All Mediums but S-Waves Don’t?**

- **P-Waves** are **longitudinal** — they compress and expand particles, which is possible in **all states (solid/liquid/gas)**.
- **S-Waves** are **transverse** — they **require rigid structure** to propagate (up-down motion), so they can’t travel through **liquids or gases** which don’t have rigidity.

---

**🌊** **2. Surface Waves (Travel on Earth’s surface)**

- Responsible for most **destruction**.
- Move **slowest**, but cause **strong vibrations**.
- Created **after body waves** reach the surface.

---

**📈** **Instruments & Measurement**

**📍** **Seismograph:**

- Device that **records ground motion** caused by seismic waves.

**📉** **Richter Scale:**

- Measures **magnitude** (energy released)
- Logarithmic scale from **1 to 10**
- Each unit increase = **10× amplitude** and **~32× energy**
- 🌍 **>6 magnitude** = Dangerous

**📊** **Mercalli Scale:**

- Measures **intensity** (damage felt)
- Ranges from **I to XII**
- Depends on **observation**, not instruments
