###  Strategy – Example: Ethics Preparation (Self Study)

This is an example of how to approach preparation in **three phases**, taking **Ethics** as a sample subject. The process breaks down the journey from understanding the syllabus to writing answers.

---

#### 📍 Step-by-Step Ethics Preparation

**Self Study**

→ Focus Area: `Ethics`  
→ Initial Focus: `PYQs` | `Syllabus` | `Source`  
→ Objective:  
`① Demystify` the subject

---

#### 🧩 Breakdown Strategy

**1. Understand the Base:**

- Use `PYQs`, the `syllabus`, and the chosen `source/book`
    
- Aim to _demystify_ what Ethics expects in Mains
    

**2. Execution Plan ("How"):**

- Fix number of `days`
    
- Identify `more important topics`
    
- Decide `Book` or resource for core reading
    

Then move to:

→ `Content Reading` (Systematic reading of chosen book/sources)

---

#### 🧠 Application Phase

**3. Active Writing (AW):**

- Work with `PYQs` and _brainstorm_ them
    
- Start to `WRITE` (new questions too)
    
    - This phase includes generating and practicing potential new questions
        
    - Based on content read + PYQ pattern
        

---

**→ Summary of the 3 Phases:**

1. **Demystify**
    
2. **Content Reading**
    
3. **Answer Writing (AW)**
    

🟢 This format should be followed for each GS paper/subject.
